# Tikz Circuits GUI (Alpha)
I luved doing my digital logic assignments in LaTeX; however, it took me so much time doing that manually, and available tools did not rlly help me. For that reason, I've decided to build my own tool out of the blue! **Still lots of improvements needed.**

## To-Do List
- [ ] Auto-crossing detection of wires
- [ ] Rotation of gates still buggy (inputs and outputs of the gates do NOT rotate)
- [ ] More styles, format, and digital components
- [ ] Zooming in and out
- [ ] Auto alignment of gates
- [ ] Completing the "Rulers" functionality
- [ ] The ability to add text

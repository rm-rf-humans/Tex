# Tikz Circuits GUI (Alpha)
I luved doing my digital logic assignments in LaTeX; however, it took me so much time doing that manually, and available tools did not rlly help me. For that reason, I've decided to build my own tool out of the blue! **Still lots of improvements needed.**

## Shortcuts
| Action               | Shortcut             |
| :------------------: | :------------------: |
| Set tool to "select" | `Ctrl + A`           |
| Set tool to "wire    | `Ctrl + W`           |
| Rotate selected gate | `Ctrl + R`           |
| Toggle grid display  | `Shift + G`          |
| Cancel current wire  | `Esc`                |

## To-Do List
- [x] ~~Drifitng happens while wiring the outputs~~
- [ ] Drifting from the gates' output while wiring in y-direction
- [ ] Auto-crossing detection of wires
- [x] ~~Rotation of gates still buggy (inputs and outputs of the gates do NOT rotate)~~
- [ ] More styles, format, and digital components
- [ ] Zooming in and out
- [ ] Auto alignment of gates
- [ ] Completing the "Rulers" functionality
- [ ] The ability to add text
- [ ] Multi-wiring from the same Node/Wire
